# gulp-powered

A Client-side Gulp build, Bootstrap-v4 powered static website app starter-kit project

## Getting Started

Whenever you think about building a soft-depended static web app project, just use this kit to start developing on it. This boilerplate-like project is completely free-to-use for your public projects.  

These instructions below will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Features
####  + Bootstrap 4 Modern Business Template
####  + Fontawesome 5 Icons
####  + jQuery.i18n Internationalization plug-in
####  + History.js
####  + Server-less
####  + Nunjucks Templating Engine

### What is going on?

When you install this project, it starts to build immediately by Gulp. Afterwards, there will be rendered files/folders inside the /dist directory. The web page you see, comes from only /dist folder and derivatives.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:


* [nodejs & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)


### Preparing

If you have already installed the packages above skip this part.
If you don't have packages above, follow instructions below:

```
1- # Download nodejs + npm bundle from https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/
2- $ npm install gulp-cli -g
3- $ npm install gulp -D
```

### Installing & Running

#### Running with Browsersync web server
```
1- $ git clone https://github.com/cagcak/gulp-powered.git && cd gulp-powered
2- $ npm i
3- $ gulp
```

or

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cagcak/gulp-powered.git && cd gulp-powered && npm i && gulp
```
> *Run `gulp minify` if you want to minify your html files inside `/dist` folder*

#### Running with live-server or other (configure port and mounting) web servers
```
1- $ git clone https://github.com/cagcak/gulp-powered.git && cd gulp-powered
2- # change DIR as 'protocol + dev + dist' instead of 'protocol + dev' in 'src/partials/main.html' / line:7
3- $ live-server --port=3000 --open=/dist
```
Now it must be running on localhost

## FAQ

#### 1: Modify i18n translation
Before gulp production all translation files must be located inside ```src/locales/i18n/```

After production they are copied into ```dist/locales/i18n/``` as ```<language-code>.json``` (ex: en.json, fr.json)

Translation strings have a key and a value like ```'my-key':'my value'``` (ex: in en.json define as ```'my-key':'my value'``` and in tr.json define as ```my-key':'benim deÄŸer')```

You can change one or add another anywhere inside .json files, then call them in html tags with ```data-``` attribute;

Before production : ```<p data-i18n="my-key"></p>```
After production :  ```<p data-i18n="my-key">my value</p>```
